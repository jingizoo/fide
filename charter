## 1  Project Purpose

RealNetworks Group will retire NetSuite, spreadsheets and point solutions and move all core finance processes onto **PeopleSoft Financials 9.2** under the programme codename **Bonafide**. The change enables multi-currency / multi-GAAP reporting, faster close, stronger audit controls and automated bank reconciliation for five European business units.

---

## 2  Background & Business Drivers

* **High-Level Questionnaire** shows 22 active customers generating \~17 invoices per month across multiple entities, yet billing is split between Excel uploads and PDF email.
* Five EU entities (UK, Austria, Portugal, Croatia, Muzicall) require separate ledgers, VAT, and bank feeds (BofA, Bankinter, mojaRBA).
* Close averages 11 calendar days and bank auto-rec matches only \~55 %.
* NetSuite lacks IFRS MultiBook and consistent VAT handling.
